## Task 1: Data Analysis and Visualization

In this task, a dataset was analyzed using Python to extract meaningful insights. The data was loaded and processed using the Pandas library, and visualizations such as bar charts were created using Matplotlib. This task demonstrates basic data preprocessing, data analysis, and visualization techniques.

**Technologies used:**
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Task 2: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This task involves developing a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area size, number of floors, and condition of the house. A real-world dataset was collected from Kaggle, preprocessed, and split into training and testing datasets. The model was trained and evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

**Technologies used:**
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

## Task 3: Matrix Operations Tool using NumPy

In this task, a Matrix Operations Tool was created using Python and the NumPy library. The application allows users to input matrices and perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, and determinant calculation. A menu-driven interactive interface was implemented to display results in a structured format.

**Technologies used:**
- Python
- NumPy
